      Engine triage in one call: the definitions with instances and incidents, the
      root incidents grouped by definition, activity, type and message with their root
      cause, overdue executable jobs (is the job executor running?), external task
      topics with waiting, locked and expired tasks (is a worker subscribed?), open
      tasks and failed batches. Every finding names the next command; --fail-on makes
      CI fail on findings.

      Requests: in parallel GET /version, GET /process-definition/statistics, GET
      /incident and /incident/count, GET /external-task and /external-task/count, GET
      /job/count and GET /job (executable, created before --stale-after), GET
      /task/count and GET /batch/statistics; then one root cause per incident group
      shown.

        --process-definition-key <key>  Only these process definition keys; repeatable
